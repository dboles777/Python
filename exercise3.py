#this is a statement outputed to the screen that begins the program and explains what we are going to be doing
print 'I will not count my chickens:'
# this will print the total number of hens following order of division then addition
print 'Hens' , 25 + 30 / 6
#this will mulitply, then modulo, then subtract the remainder of multiplication divided by 4
print 'Roosters' , 100 - 25 * 3 % 4
#another output statement
print 'Now I will count the eggs:'
#this will will follow the order of operations then process left to right
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 -1 / 4 + 6
#another output statment
print 'Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?'
#this tests if the statement is true and outputs true or false
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
#this outputs a statment and outputs the sum of addition
print 'What is 3 + 2?' , 3 + 2
#this outputs a statement and then shows us the difference of the subtraction
print 'What is 5 - 7?' , 5 - 7
#another output statment
print "Oh, that's why it is False."
#another output statment
print "How about some more."
#output statement and tests if one number is greater than the other outputing true or false
print "Is it greater?" , 5 > -2
#output statement testing if number is greater or equal and outputs true of false
print "Is it greater than or equal?" , 5 >= -2
#output statment testing if one number is less than or equal and outputs true or false
print "Is it less or equal?" , 5 <= -2
